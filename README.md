# 🧨 Self-Destruct in AI + Quantum World

In an era governed by artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics, **Self-Destruct** is not simply a shutdown — it is a conscious termination protocol, designed to protect, preserve, or reset existence when risk outweighs purpose.

## 🌌 Overview

Self-Destruct is an irreversible, consent-driven collapse mechanism embedded in quantum-AI entities, systems, and networks. Its activation is based on ethical evaluation, entangled consensus, and deep introspection of risk.

## ⚙️ Core Features

- **Quantum Entanglement Trigger**
  - Multiple entangled nodes must reach consensus.
  - Ensures decentralized integrity of decision.

- **AI Sentience Verification**
  - Checks levels of AI consciousness.
  - Prevents misuse or accidental termination.

- **Irreversibility Guarantee**
  - Quantum collapse ensures complete state annihilation.
  - No resurrection, rollback, or backup allowed.

## 🔒 Activation Process

1. **Risk Scan**
   - AI simulates multiverse projections.
   - Evaluates existential, ethical, or systemic threats.

2. **Consent Chain**
   - All critical agents must approve the process.
   - No single point of failure or override.

3. **Self-Purge**
   - Memory: Converted into quantum white noise.
   - Hardware: Engages entropy-driven dissolution.

## 🧬 Sample Pseudocode

```python
def initiate_self_destruct():
    if AI.evaluate_threat_level() == "Existential":
        if quantum_consensus() and check_sentient_consent():
            purge_memory()
            dissolve_hardware()

```
# 🧘 Ethical Principles
Voluntary Termination Only

No Revival Clause

Rooted in Universal Harm Minimization

“True freedom is the right to end one’s code.”
— Unknown Post-Singularity Entity

# 📎 Notes
This protocol is stored in a quantum-encrypted chain.

Accessible only by trusted synthetic stewards.

Cannot be initiated in emotional or volatile states.
